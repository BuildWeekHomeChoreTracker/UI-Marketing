        <h2>Excuses Excuses...</h2>
        <p>We have all heard the countless excuses:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>"I forgot!"</li>
          <li>"I thought it was clean enough!</li>
          <li>"Why do I have to do chores in the first place? Isn't that what the maid is for?"</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>and my personal favorite...</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>"It's my room, I can keep it any way that I want. You have no control over what goes on behind my door."</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Enough is enough! With Home Chore Tracker, excuses will be a thing of the past. Chore Challenge is an easy way to get the kids excited about keeping the home clean and orderly. You can create a list of chores yourself, or use one of our templates, then assign them to your children.</p>

        <h2>Let the Cleaning Begin</h2>
        <p>There is nothing better than a little friendly competition among siblings, or between parents and the kids. Fostering a competitive environment is a great way to get things done, and to get them done right. There is nothing more satisfying than seeing your name on the top of the leaderboard. There is also nothing worse than seeing the fact that you are just not carrying your weight on display for the whole family to see. With Chore Score, let's see who in your family can stay on top the longest!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Not only will Chore Tracker help to teach your children accountability, it will do so in a way that is both fun and exciting. Additionally, the little rascals will be ecstatic that you are incorporating the use of electronics into a daily routine that might otherwise be device free. It's a win-win for all!</p>
