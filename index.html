        <h2>Excuses Excuses...</h2>
        <p>We have all heard the countless excuses:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>"I forgot!"</li>
          <li>"I thought it was clean enough!</li>
          <li>"Why do I have to do chores in the first place? Isn't that what the maid is for?"</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>and my personal favorite...</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>"It's my room, I can keep it any way that I want. You have no control over what goes on behind my door."</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Enough is enough! With Home Chore Tracker, excuses will be a thing of the past. Chore Challenge is an easy way to get the kids excited about keeping the home clean and orderly. You can create a list of chores yourself, or use one of our templates, then assign them to your children.</p>

        <h2>Let the Cleaning Begin</h2>
        <p>Home Chore Tracker allows you to create an account and add your children to the family. Each child will have their own account to login. Once you have established your family, you, the parent, can randomly assign your children chores, and each child will be able to see the chores they have been assigned.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Not only will Chore Tracker help to teach your children accountability, it will do so in a way that is both fun and exciting. Additionally, the little rascals will be ecstatic that you are incorporating the use of electronics into a daily routine that might otherwise be device free. It's a win-win for all!</p>

            <h2>No More Ambiguity With Chore Checker</h2>
            <p>Are you tired of the back-talk and the under-the -breath commentary when you have to tell your children to redo something that was not done satisfactorily? Home Chore Tracker puts your child’s destiny in their own hands. By requiring a photo to be uploaded for approval before a chore can be marked as complete, your children will think twice before they decide whether that particular chore on their list is done to acceptable standards.</p>

        <h4>Let's Make Chores Fun Again</h4>
        <p>There is nothing better than a little friendly competition amongst siblings, or between parents and the kids. Fostering a competitive environment is a great way to get things done, and to get them done right. There is nothing more satisfying than seeing your name on the top of the leaderboard. There is also nothing worse than seeing the fact that you are just not carrying your weight on display for the whole family to see. With Chore Score, let's see who in your family can stay on top the longest!</p>
